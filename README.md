# Task Management API

RESTful API for task management built with TypeScript, Express, and TypeORM.

## Entities Description

### User

User entity represents system users with authentication and authorization capabilities.

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier (auto-generated)
- `email` - User's email (unique, required)
- `password` - Hashed password (required)
- `username` - User's username (unique, optional)
- `name` - User's full name (optional)
- `role` - User role: `STANDARD` or `ADMINISTRATOR` (default: `STANDARD`)
- `language` - Preferred language (default: `en-US`)
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

**Relationships:**

- One user can have many States (one-to-many)
- One user can have many TaskTypes (one-to-many)
- One user can have many Tasks (one-to-many)

### State

State entity represents task statuses (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"). Each user can create their own custom states.

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier (auto-generated)
- `name` - State name (max 100 characters, required)
- `userId` - Reference to the owner user
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

**Relationships:**

- Many-to-one with User (each state belongs to one user)

### TaskType

TaskType entity represents task categories or types (e.g., "Bug", "Feature", "Documentation"). Each user can create their own custom task types.

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier (auto-generated)
- `name` - Task type name (max 100 characters, required)
- `userId` - Reference to the owner user
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

**Relationships:**

- Many-to-one with User (each task type belongs to one user)

### Task

Task entity represents individual tasks with all their details.

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier (auto-generated)
- `title` - Task title (max 200 characters, required)
- `description` - Task description (optional)
- `priority` - Task priority: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH` (required)
- `userId` - Reference to the owner user (auto-assigned, cannot be changed)
- `stateId` - Reference to the task's state (required, must belong to user)
- `taskTypeId` - Reference to the task's type (required, must belong to user)
- `dueDate` - Task due date (required)
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

**Relationships:**

- Many-to-one with User (each task belongs to one user)
- Many-to-one with State (each task has one state)
- Many-to-one with TaskType (each task has one type)

**Validation Rules:**

- When creating a task, all fields except `description` are required
- `stateId` and `taskTypeId` must reference entities that belong to the authenticated user
- `userId` is automatically assigned from JWT token and cannot be modified
